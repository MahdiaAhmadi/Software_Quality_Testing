# Quality in Software System

> This simple project was done as part of the quality of the information system subject in IPB.


### 1. Read the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)

### 2. Develop a simple application, with at least 5 functions

#### Purpose of the Application

> The app is essentially a small contact management system with built-in validation. It's useful in contexts like:

- Storing and managing a directory of contacts.
- Ensuring that all data entered into the system adheres to specific formats, especially for phone numbers.
- Quickly searching for and modifying stored information about individuals.

#### Application Functionalities

1. Add a Person:
   Add a new person to the list with validated name, email, phone, and country, assigning them a unique ID.

2. Remove a Person:
   Remove a person from the list using their unique ID.

3. View All People:
   Display all stored people along with their details (id, name, email, phone, and country).

4. Find a Person:
   Search for a person by their unique ID or name (case-insensitive).

5. Validate Input Data:
   Ensure data integrity by validating name, email, and phone based on the specified country format.

### 3. Create unit tests for each of the applicationâ€™s functions and execute both of them (generate an XML with the Test Execution Result)

> the test of each function is done in the test_people_list.py file.

### 4. ASVS Requirement that I choose

>

    5.1.4 - Verify that structured data is strongly typed and validated against a defined schema including allowed characters, length and pattern (e.g. credit card numbers, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, or validating that two related fields are reasonable, such as checking that suburb and zip/postcode match).


### 6. Pytest How-to-run

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

pytest test_people_list.py -v
```
